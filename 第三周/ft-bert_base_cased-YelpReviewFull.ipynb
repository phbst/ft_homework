       "      <td>We had a late, light dinner here tonight.  It was recommended by our B&amp;B host and is an easy block and a half walk.  The building is old and the d\\u00e9cor is charming and eclectic.  The room you enter has the bar and it's noisier than the room to the left.  We were greeted warmly and given our choice of tables.  We chose the quieter room.  Tables are covered w/ butcher paper.  There's a bilingual menu and the table d'h\\u00f4te is on a blackboard.  Many things looked good, but we weren't hungry enough for anything major.  \\n\\nAlan chose the smoked salmon entr\\u00e9e (entr\\u00e9e here is an appetizer at home).  Our hostess was concerned that it wouldn't be enough for him.  I chose a four cheese sandwich w/ tomato and pesto.  It was heated but not grilled as a panini is.  It came w/ a choice of fries or salad and I chose the latter.  Both salad and sandwich were tasty.  Alan was pleased w/ his salmon.  He had bites of the salad and of the sandwich, so we both had enough food because I wasn't as hungry as he was.  We both had water to drink.  Service was friendly and accommodating and the food hit the spot.  3.51, rounded up.</td>\n",

The layout of the place is not conducive at all to efficient flow of traffic. Once we parked it was a hike to get to the stadium itself so note to self for Spring Training next year:\\\"Leave two hours before the game starts\\\"\\nOnce we got to the stadium it was nice enough. We had seats by third base which weren't bad but this place is a little bigger than the other places I hit so I wasn't impressed by the seats. They have good food options at the concession stand and they have batting cages and a merry-go-round for kids which was good for me because an obnoxious brat was sitting behind me kicking my seat and being loud. I can only assume that his parents, after finally realizing that their kid was pissing me off, took him to the merry go round....otherwise I would have used him for batting practice.  \\nThe entire complex itself is nice:they have a park and a pool and of course the stadium itself.

We came to Vegas for a wedding and stayed here as the bride had booked a block of rooms. The only plus thus far is that it's pretty central within the strip. \\n\\nThus far: Parking is a nightmare. There is construction going on where the usual entrance would be and the only signage is a tiny sign hidden behind trees letting you know to make a U-turn and go around back. Then, the elevators from the parking garage to the lobby are disgusting. They look like death. Not to mention, parts are missing - as in, you look up, you can see the cables. Super re-assuring.\\n\\nCheck in: We arrived at 11pm on a Wednesday. We were waiting 30+ minutes to check in! I would have to imagine they're used to crowds, they should really have more than 4 people checking people in. Yowza. \\n\\nRoom: The room (if you get an updated one) is fine. It's big (we had two queens, standard room). Problems: The bathroom vent fan filter was absolutely filthy. Dust everywhere. The toilet and the shower ran - constant noise. Both the lights in the room didn't work. Walls are very thin, you can hear everyone and everything in the halls and next door. Also, ask if you are going to face the pool area - music blasts until about midnight (Which I don't mind so much, but you'll want to know). The beds, I will say, are super comfortable. No complaints there.\\n\\nWe ordered room service - a 'movie package' which included 'large popcorn, Red Vines, two sodas and two bottles of water\\\" - $25.00. When I called to order the lady put me on hold three times and finally said \\\"I'll call you back\\\" because apparently this was a new menu item and she couldn't find it. When she did call back, I had to remind her about the sodas. What arrived (45 minutes later): Two bags of microwave popcorn (half popped), 4 Red Vines, two glasses of water, and two mini-bottles of soda. Excellent. \\n\\nOverall, I'm not impressed at all. I love the history of this place, and its location, but it's so not compensating for the rest of the mess.</td>\n",
